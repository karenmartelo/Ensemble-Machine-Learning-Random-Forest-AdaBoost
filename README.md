# Ensembled ML: Random Forest & AdaBoost

This repository contains implementations and experiments with **ensemble machine learning techniques**, focusing on **Random Forest**, **AdaBoost**, and related foundational concepts such as **bagging**, **bootstrap sampling**, and the **bias–variance tradeoff**.

The goal of this project is to understand how ensemble methods improve model performance, robustness, and generalization compared to single learners.
